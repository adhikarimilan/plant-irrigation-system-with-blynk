<h2>1.1	Project Objectives</h2>
<p>The project’s main objective is to create and deploy an IoT controlled hydroponic system that boosts efficiency, automation, as well as remote access in plant growth management. Then, traditional hydroponic systems lack a degree of automation and manual intervention on the part of the owner is required to maintain optimal conditions. This project integrates IoT based automation to address these limitations by smart monitoring, automated irrigation and fail safe mechanisms.
The objectives that are specific to this project include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To design and develop a hydroponic system using horizontal pipes for efficient plant growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutrient rich water solutions, not soil, are used along with hydroponic farming which can produce high yields in space.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal pipes will be used to make a compact, structured and scalable hydroponic framework, a system to grow plants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To integrate IoT for remote monitoring and control of the system via the Blynk app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Real time monitoring and remote access to system parameters like moisture, water flow and nutrients will be enabled with the help of the Blynk IoT platform.</li>
<li>Mobile applications that are powered by the IoT reduce human effort and improve the consistency of their plant growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To implement a moisture sensor for real-time monitoring of moisture levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil or water moisture content will be monitored by moisture sensors continuously and used for precise water management.</li>
<li>Data from studies indicate that real time irrigation systems using sensors can increase water efficiency by 40% more compared to monitoring using manual means.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To automate the watering system in case of internet disconnection</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the IoT based hydroponic systems are internet dependent and thus prone to network failure.</li>
<li>This work will construct an offline capable automated watering mechanism and irrigation system to prevent system from being disconnected during connectivity issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To display real-time data on an LCD screen and indicate offline status using an LED.</p>
<ul>
<li>An LCD module will display essential data such as moisture levels, motor status, and system warnings.</li>
<li>Failures of the sensors or disconnection of the network will be shown to the users with an LED indicator so that immediate maintenance and intervention will be employed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To evaluate the system’s efficiency in managing plant growth and resource utilization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data driven evaluation metrics will be used to analyze performance of the system based on water consumption, plant health and energy efficiency.</li>
<li>The results will be compared with traditional hydroponic setup as to how automation, scalability and sustainability are improved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.2	Scope of the Project</h2>
<p>The project builds an IoT-based hydroponic system that evaluates plant growth efficiency together with resource management through design and implementation stages. Multiple components will merge with the system to enable automated functions and real-time system monitoring.</p>
<h3>Hardware Components:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drilling pipes serves as structural elements which guide water movement while supporting plants related tasks to deliver nutrients through the pipelines.</li>
<li>The submerged motor will function as a water circulating device for maintaining continuous system operation.</li>
<li>NodeMCU Microcontroller operates as the system’s main control unit while handling the data processing equaling hardware communication links.</li>
<li>The system will include a moisture detector which measures growing medium water levels to optimize plant hydration with minimum water resources.</li>
<li>The LCD Display will transmit real-time information encompassing moisture levels and system status data for user viewing benefit.</li>
<li>One of the system components is an LED indicator that shows both operational messages and warning notifications for offline conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Components:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remote system monitoring and control functions of the system will be enabled by the Blynk app which allows users to operate and supervise their systems through their smartphone.
Automated Watering Functionality:</li>
<li>The programmed automatic plant watering feature will continue watering operations in case the internet connection fails to prevent irrigation disruptions. Offline capability of this system will become operational due to this important function.
Performance Evaluation and System Efficiency Analysis:</li>
<li>The assessment of system efficiency focuses on measuring water consumption together with plant condition along with power utilization. Performance tests that run at regular intervals will show what extent the system reaches its goals.
This initiative excludes the following aspects from its scope of work:</li>
<li>The system maintains small to medium-level hydroponic application functionality but does not operate effectively in industrial commercial environments.</li>
<li>Predictive analysis using advanced AI tech is absent from the system because it lacks artificial intelligence-based capabilities.</li>
</ul>
